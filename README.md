# StockPriceForecastML
Python program using machine learning to forecast stock prices in bulk

1) There are some things I have done in the loop that can be done outside of it for efficiency.
2) I was trying to engineer some different features and thought I would try daily stock price range/volume (still evaluating use).
3) There are more Pythonic ways of doing some of the things I have done, but this is still a work in progress.
4) I will properly annotate the graphs in the future
